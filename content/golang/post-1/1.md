# Problem

How to limit number of goroutines from inside an infinite loop?


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	totalGoRoutines := 5

	fmt.Println("Start\n")
	for i := 0; i < totalGoRoutines; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go counter(i, &wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("\n\nDone!")
}

// Counter prints count number
func counter(count int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()

	fmt.Printf("Count: %d\n", count)
}
```

In above scenario, all goroutines were started simultaneously.

I want to:

1. start `n` goroutines simultaneously

2. wait

3. start another set of `n` goroutines simultaneously


# Solution

1. We use buffered channel `channel1` whose maximum capacity is equal to number of goroutines we want running simultaneously

2. Before executing it's task, each goroutine sends value into channel

3. The value that goes into channel doesn't matter

4. If channel is full, sending data will fail

5. If sending data succeeds, goroutine proceeds with it's task

6. After task is done, it reads from channel and channel is free to receive another value


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	totalGoRoutines := 20
	maxGoRoutines := 2

	channel1 := make(chan struct{}, maxGoRoutines)

	fmt.Println("Start\n")
	for i := 0; i < totalGoRoutines; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go counter(i, &wg, channel1)

		if i%maxGoRoutines == 0 && i != totalGoRoutines {
			fmt.Println("\nWaiting!\n")
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
		}
	}

	wg.Wait()
	close(channel1)
	fmt.Println("\n\nDone!")
}

// Counter prints count number
func counter(count int, wg *sync.WaitGroup, channel1 chan struct{}) {
	defer wg.Done()
	channel1 <- struct{}{}
	fmt.Printf("Count: %d\n", count)
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	<-channel1
}
```
