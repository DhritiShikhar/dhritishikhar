# Introduction

Usually, options to limit number of goroutines are:
1. For Loop
2. Semaphores

But, How to limit number of goroutines from inside an infinite loop?


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	totalGoRoutines := 5

	fmt.Println("Start\n")
	for i := 0; i < totalGoRoutines; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go counter(i, &wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("\n\nDone!")
}

// Prints count number
func counter(count int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()

	fmt.Printf("Count: %d\n", count)
}
```

Output:

In above scenario, all goroutines were started simultaneously.

I want to:
1. start `n` goroutines simultaneously
2. wait
3. start another set of `n` goroutines simultaneously


# Solution


```go

```
